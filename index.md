## Welcome to our coding aspect of the interview

We want to get a sense of your ability to do some of more specific tasks in the PennLINC labratory. 
As a data analyst, a lot of your job will be data downloading, wrangling, and processing.
We also want to see your creative / scientific side. 

Here, you will download functional connectivity matrices from the Human Connectome Project. This requires making an account on thier data downloader webiste [ConnectomeDB](https://db.humanconnectome.org/app/template/Login.vm)

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
