## Welcome to our coding aspect of the interview

We want to get a sense of your ability to do some of more specific tasks in the PennLINC labratory. As a data analyst, a lot of your job will be data downloading, wrangling, and processing. We also want to see your creative, scientific talents. 

First, you will download functional connectivity matrices from the Human Connectome Project. This specific dataset is called the [HCP1200 Parcellation + Timeseries + Netmats (1003 Subjects)](https://www.humanconnectome.org/storage/app/media/documentation/s1200/HCP1200-DenseConnectome+PTN+Appendix-July2017.pdf). Downloading requires making an account on thier data downloader webiste [ConnectomeDB](https://db.humanconnectome.org/app/template/Login.vm).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
