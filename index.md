# Welcome to our coding aspect of the interview

We want to get a sense of your ability to do some of more specific tasks in the PennLINC labratory. As a data analyst, a lot of your job will be data downloading, wrangling, and processing. We also want to see your creative, scientific talents. 

## Download functional connectivity matrices from the Human Connectome Project
### Connectome DB Account
Downloading this data requires making an account on thier data downloader webiste [ConnectomeDB](https://db.humanconnectome.org/app/template/Login.vm).
### Aspera Connect Plug-In
You will also need a plug-in called [Aspera Connect](https://downloads.asperasoft.com/connect2/)
### Download the data! 
This specific dataset is called the [HCP1200 Parcellation + Timeseries + Netmats (1003 Subjects)](https://www.humanconnectome.org/storage/app/media/documentation/s1200/HCP1200-DenseConnectome+PTN+Appendix-July2017.pdf). They call them Netmats, which is short for network matrices, which are functional connectivity matrices. Once you are logged in to ConnectomeDB, and you have the plug-in active, you can download the [Netmats](https://db.humanconnectome.org/app/action/ChooseDownloadResources?project=HCP_Resources&resource=GroupAvg&filePath=HCP1200_Parcellation_Timeseries_Netmats_recon2.zip)
